# Forked from https://github.com/delight-im/PHP-Auth
### For documentation on the original library, see https://github.com/delight-im/PHP-Auth

## Differences in this version:
1. User ID's will be random strings.
2. Every DB table that has a user ID is now varchar(32) instead of bigint.
3. I'm sure I'll make for modifications!
